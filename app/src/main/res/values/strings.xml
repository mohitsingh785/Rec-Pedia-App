An aim bound, time bound free expressing media is essential for any organisation or country. Availability of an accessible media is always grateful for any organization.\nToday REC Pedia is recognized as the official media and magazine body of our REC. When our college was going through various irregularities and hustle & bustle, some of our seniors, holding the flag of positive reforms launched REC Pedia on Facebook page on April 2017. These founding group of seniors were not only brilliant but also courageous as well as non fearful of consequences because at that time, Launching of such official clubs were a hard nut to crack.\n\nIn today\'s time it\'s much easier to take any initiative or form any club but it wasn\'t so some years ago. Thanks to those Daredevils who established REC Pedia in 2017.\nAt beginning the name of this club was \'REC Media\' but later on changed to REC Pedia on September 2017. Those seniors reformed and renewed the legacy of annual fest and named it \'आrambh 1.O\' the Cultural and Tech fest of Rewa Engineering College.\nInitial working of Pedia started right from there. From initial planning of events to execution; From prior notices to covering events; From highlights to conclusions; RECPedia electrified the whole REC system and this legacy is still going on and Will Go On !\nWorking as Media, REC Pedia covered & published each and every seminars, events, notices, schedules as well as cultural, technical & sports activities. Along with आrambh, REC Pedia organises Independence Day, Republic Day and other festivals . \nREC Pedia also worked as working hand of Rewa Engineering College by keeping up the social values & responsibilities and organised a 7 day long \'Charity Event\' the biggest event in history of REC from 16 August 2018 to 22 August 2018. Our Instagram page of REC Pedia was launched during that period. \n Seeing a large number of talents in REC but a lack in platforms to promote their talents, REC Pedia launched all time running free shout-out for talents of all kinds called as #rectalent. \n\n Seeking the Aarambh, The Annual Fest, The mashup of Cultural, Intellectual & Technical Events, the Fun it carries, The smiles it brings; going into the wastebasket amidst Covid-19; REC Pedia rolled its sleeves to offer straws for drowning hopes to clutch. REC Pedia launched ･ิ･ิRhythm･ิ･ิ an another remix of Culture & Science, History & Technology, Presentation & Knowledge, Win & Lose, Struggle & Fight, Smiles & Clapping, Recognitions & Appreciations, a prominent & mammoth series of virtual events. The 4-days long journey of Rhythm began on 12 Sept & ended on 15 Sept 2020.\nWith a promise to keep working on it\'s legacy, REC Pedia is always available in the service of REC & RECians !\n\n\nWith Love,\nREC Pedia]]></string>
